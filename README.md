# Out of Words
We needed a way to display HTML-based articles (pulled from various Read-it-Later services) in a responsive way, so I created this framework to normalise & layout/display them. Due to having no control over what markup may come my way, this is a sometimes tedious task. Due to [Words](http://www.newnet-soft.com/words) having two different ways to display your articles, every theme has a single column (vertical scrolling) & a multi column (horizontal scrolling) view.

## Requirements
This framework is built using LESS & is tested only in WebKit (due to our app being a Mac app, no other browser engines are necessary :)...).

## Early stage
This framework is a rewrite of the existing one operating in Words at the moment & will ship as soon as it is ready. But at the moment I am still working on the basics. So don't expect everything to be perfect. In case you find a bug or have an idea or feature wish, let me know, fork & hack on.

## Credits
Thanks to the awesome guys of [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) for their great "typographic starter kit", which I utilise in Out of Words.
